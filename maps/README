A world is built from a txt file.

The following characters are used :

'X' - Wall
' ' - empty block
'.' - empty block that can't be filled with food (unreachable by the snake)
'S' - initial position of the snake
'F' - a food element (food is added by the code,
      no need to place elements on the initial world)
