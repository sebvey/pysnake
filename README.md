# Description

This project is an implementation of the snake game in Python.
It was first written during the Wagon bootcamp and used as a demo during the
project presentations.

The project was to develop an AI playing the snake game. I planned to use
Reinforcement Learning to train this AI.

Reinforcement Learning is the training of machine learning models to make
a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an environment
This demo was used to demonstrate that the environment was easy to develop.
Pygame was used for the visual aspect.

This AI project had not been choosen during the Bootcamp and maybe will be done
as a personal project later.

# Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
deactivate; virtualenv -ppython3 ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Clone the project and install it:
